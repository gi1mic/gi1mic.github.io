<h1><center>The $19 DIY DSP audio filter</center></h1>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This is a low cost open source audio DSP filter for Radio Hams. It is released as a building block for anyone who wants to design or customise their own audio filters.</p>
<p>It is different from commercial offerings because it is cheap, can contain multiple filter profiles and uses voice messages to describe which filter has been selected.</p>

<p>While I am using the board with a Yaesu FT-817 it is be easily adaptable to any other rig or fitted inside an amplified speaker as described later</p>
<p>The design is based around a $19 Teensy 3.2 board along with a handful of other components which most radio hams probably have in their junk box. The board is programmed using the Arduino IDE and takes audio in via an ADC, filters it using a software defined FIR filter and outputs it via a DAC.</p>
<p>I am currently working on adding Morse and DTMF to speech decoding but that will require and additional SD card to hold the additional speech files. After that I will probably add a rotary encoder and a small OLED display to allow the board to do twin passband filters.</p>
<p>Before anyone asks - no you cannot use an Arduino to do this.</p>
<p>This is only a starting point and not meant to be a detailed introduction to Teensy or DSP filters. There are many other cool things that could be done with this board and library.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Quick Start</h1>
<p>Just want to try it without the hassle of setting up a development environment? </p>
<p>Download a recent HEX file from the "bin" folder and use the Teensy command line loader as described <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/loader_cli.html">here</a>

<h1>Setting up a development environment</h1>
<p>This is well documented on the <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html">Teensy Web Site</a> in principle you need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the latest <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html">Teensyduino</a> and check which versions of the Arduino IDE are supported (At the time of writing IDE 1.82)</li>
<li>Download and install the relevant <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software">Arduino IDE</a></li>
<li>Install <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html">Teensyduino</a> on top of the Arduino IDE</li>
<li>Load up one of the Teensy examples included with the IDE and plug in a Teensy 3.2</li>
<li>On the Tools menu option set
<ul>
<li>Teensy: 3.1/3.2</li>
<li>USB Type: serial</li>
<li>CPU Speed: 96Mhz</li>
<li>Optimize: Faster</li>
<li>Com Port: Set as required to select the Teensy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Select &ldquo;Sketch/Upload&rdquo; to flash the Teensy and run the code.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you are happy with the basics you can try out the DSP Sketch with its sample filters and then move on to creating your own filters and voice prompts!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Downloading the source</h1>
https://github.com/gi1mic/19Dollar-DSP-Filter
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Testing using amplified speaker</h1>
<p>You can test the board using any rig by simply feeding the sets audio output into the audio input of the Teensy. A 50ohm resistor acts as a load while a 10uf cap decouples the audio input. The Teensy DAC is then to an amplified speaker via a 10nf cap.</p>
<p>You will need to check the debug output using a terminal to make sure the peak values generally don't exceed 1.0</p>
<p> You will also probably want to modify the code to change the pinMode from INPUT to INPUT_PULLUP so you can simply use a switch between GND and PIN0.</p>
<p>I'm hopeless at using Fritzing but these images should give you a rough idea of how to wire it up</p>

<p><strong>WARNING: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Make sure you cut the PCB track on the Teensy which connects the external RAW and USB power together. Failure to do this may damage your PC USB port if the board is fitted to the FT-817. Cutting this track means the Teensy is no longer powered via USB.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fitting the Teensy DSP filter to an FT-817 requires the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>removal of the main PCB to gain access to the underside.</li>
<li>Tapping a power feed</li>
<li>Breaking into the audio chain so we can insert the DSP in line</li>
<li>Tapping of a digital trigger signal that we can use to configure different modes</li>
<li>Insert a CW filter bypass if a CW filter is not already fitted</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Removing the main PCB</h2>

<h2>Getting a power feed</h2>
<p>PWR is taken straight directly of the FT817 PCB. On my rig this provides 9.6V when the FT-817 is used with a 13.8V external power source. The voltage regulators fitted to the Teensy 3.2 boards are a LP38691 which is rated at 10V max (Teensy documentation states 6V max). I added an inline power diode to drop the input another 0.6V to create some headroom. While close to the limit the regulator does not get excessively warm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://gi1mic.github.io/images/image006.jpg" width="800" alt="Power Feed" >
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Breaking into the audio chain</h2>
<p>Remove C1338 and attach two shielded audio cables as below. You can easily determine which is the the audio amplifier by simply tapping the bare end and listening for mains hum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://gi1mic.github.io/images/image007.jpg" width="800" alt="Audio Feed" >
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Audio input to the Teensy is accomplished using one of the ADC convertors on pin PA2.&nbsp; This is decoupled from the FT817 via a 10nf ceramic cap. I used a 6.8K resistor between PA2 and GND to limit the input as it was saturating the ADC. You can verify if you need to adjust this value later using a terminal emulator connected to the Teensy once the code is loaded.</p>
<p>Audio output from the Teensy comes from the internal 12bit DAC. This has a much higher quality output than PWM outputs used by most single chip systems. Again, the DAC is decoupled from the FT817 via a 10nf ceramic cap.</p>
<p>Use the built-in debugging info to ensure the audio level remains mostly bellow 1.0. If it constantly exceeds this level, you will need to lower it by changing the input resistor or change it to a proper voltage divider.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>CW filter bypass</h2>
<p>You can skip this if you have a physical CW filter fitted. Otherwise add two 10nf ceramic caps as shown below. These act as an audio pass-through for the missing filter when it is selected.</p>
<img src="https://gi1mic.github.io/images/image008.jpg" width="800" alt="CW Bypass" >
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Trigger</h2>
<p>For the moment add a small signal wire (green wire) as shown below. This is used to switch filter modes.</p>
<p>Connect the wire to PIN0 on the Teensy which is configured as an active low input toggle. It is used to select between the different audio filters. Since the signal I am using from the FT817 has a level higher than 3.2V it is feed via a simple voltage divider consisting of two resistors. The Teensy has 5V tolerant inputs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://gi1mic.github.io/images/image009.jpg" width="800" alt="Trigger" >
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the future, I aim to take mode signal(s) from switching IC Q1049 allowing automatic selection of filters based on the modulation mode of the radio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the cables fitted it&rsquo;s time to resemble the radio ensuring no wires are trapped or nipped.</p>

<h1>Teensy</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Schematic</h2>
<img src="https://gi1mic.github.io/images/image010.jpg" width="800" alt="Schematic" >
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you can see there are only six components external to the Teensy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://gi1mic.github.io/images/image011.png" width="800" alt="Pin Out" >
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Debugging</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once programmed the device will appear as a standard serial port. Use the built in Arduino IDE Serial Monitor or a terminal program of your choice to connect to the board at 9600 Baud, 8,N,1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Debug output format</p>
<ul>
<li>Start-up message</li>
<li>Peak audio input level</li>
<li>CPU utilisation</li>
<li>Mode changes</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Prototype</h2>
<p>This was my initial hacked together audio used in testing before I discovered the level was too high.</p>
<p>The following images shows my test board and power connection and the shrink wrap ready to go. Initially I was using PIN1 as the mode switch as show in the photo. I have since switched to PIN0 as reflected in the sample code to simplify the hardware.</p>

<h2>Generating new DSP filters</h2>
<h3>Free Online Tool</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to <a href="http://t-filter.engineerjs.com/">http://t-filter.engineerjs.com/</a> and use the Predefined drop down to select one of the predefined filter types such as Bandpass.</p>
<img src="https://gi1mic.github.io/images/image014.png" width="800" alt="Online Tool" >
<p>Change the frequency to 44117 HZ.</p>
<p>Now modify the filter to obtain the desired result.</p>
<p>Use the &ldquo;Filter Design and Analysis&rdquo; button to recalculate the design as required. Note it is important to set the maximum number of taps or check the actual number of taps has an even number and does not exceed the Teensy maximum of 200. If this is a real problem, modify the code to daisy chain multiple filters together. You should be able to chain three or four filters before maxing out the processor (check debugging for CPU utilisation info).</p>
<p>When you are happy you can export the coefficients as a 16bit int "C/C++ array" option.&nbsp; You will need to modify the "int" to "short" in the generated code for it to work with the Teensy.</p>
<p>Now you can update filters.h to add your newly designed code and then add the new filters into the &ldquo;fir_filter fir_list&rdquo; array in the main Sketch using the existing code as an example.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Using MATLAB</h3>
<p>Fire up MATLAB and go to the APPS menu. Then select the &ldquo;Filter Builder&rdquo; app under &ldquo;Signal Processing and Communications&rdquo;.</p>
<img src="https://gi1mic.github.io/images/image015.jpg" width="800" alt="Matlab" >
<ol>
<li>Set the Frequency Specification to 44117 HZ.</li>
<li>Select a response type such as Bandpass</li>
<li>Select one of the FIR filter types</li>
<li>Specify a maximum order of 200 - If this is a real problem, modify the code to daisy chain multiple filters together. You should be able to chain three or four filters before maxing out the processor (check debugging for CPU utilisation info).</li>
<li>There is no five I&rsquo;m just checking to see if you are still awake</li>
<li>Specify the parameters for your specific filter type</li>
<li>Click the Design Filter button to model the filter and update the graph</li>
<li>When happy select the &ldquo;Targets Menu/Generate C Header&rdquo; option</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://gi1mic.github.io/images/image016.png" alt="Matlab Export" >
<p>The Numerator and Numerator length are simply the names used in the generated file for the coefficients. I would recommend using something line filterXXXXX and filterLenXXXXX.</p>
<p>Export the files as Unsigned 16bit integers for compatibility with the Teensy development environment. The files should be saved into your development environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can then update filters.h to add your newly designed code and then add the filters into the &ldquo;fir_filter fir_list&rdquo; array in the main Sketch using the existing code as an example.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Generating Audio Prompts</h2>
<p>Audio prompts are used to identify filters as they are selected. Creating a new audio prompt requires creating a suitable WAV file and then converting that into a data (C Array) for use inside the application.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Creating a WAV file</h3>
<p>An easy way to create the WAV file is to use the online system <a href="https://online-voice-recorder.com/">https://online-voice-recorder.com/</a> this allows you to record a message and trim it to suit. When you are happy you can save the final message to a directory on your computer.</p>
<p>Now use http://audio.online-convert.com/convert-to-wav to convert the saved MP3 file to the WAV format. You can drop the audio quality down (try 8bit@11025hz) to save flash memory in the final code. After all it's not like we need HD audio for this application</p>
<p>Tip: if you need to perform batch conversions have a look at <a href="http://www.audacityteam.org"> audacity</a> and <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/lamexp/">lamexp</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>WAV file conversion</h3>
<p>WAV file conversion requires a windows command line application called <a href="https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/Audio/tree/master/extras/wav2sketch">wav2sketch</a>. Simply put it in a folder along with the WAV file(s) you generated earlier and run it. Detailed instructions can be found <a href="https://forum.pjrc.com/threads/42401-Instructions-or-tutorials-for-using-wav2sketch?p=135069&amp;viewfull=1#post135069">here</a>.</p>
<p>Once the conversion has finished it will have created a CPP and H file for each input WAV file. All you need to do is add these to you project using the existing sample files as examples.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Background</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A while ago I spotted some third-party add-on DSP filters for the FT-817. A quick visual inspection of the product photographs showed they were probably based on the PIC32MX range of microprocessor and like any good hacker I ordered up a couple of low cost dev boards.</p>
<p>While waiting for the boards I started researching DSP filter implementations including reading the DSP chapter in the ARRL handbook. This was all well and good but I did not turn up any great examples of working code.</p>
<p>Anyway, by the time the boards arrived I had become started some other projects so the boards were consigned to my growing stash of low cost processor boards with the aim of looking at them at some point in the future.</p>
<p>Jump forward a month or so and I happen to be reading an article on <a href="http://hackaday.com/2017/04/29/teensy-and-3d-printer-make-beautiful-music-together/#more-254819">Hackaday</a> covering the use of a <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/">Teensy</a> board as an audio synthesiser. After watching the linked <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbcNqarBTsI">video</a> of the device in action I became intrigued as to how such a low-cost device could generate incredible audio.</p>
<p>At this point I had never looked at the <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/">Teensy</a> in detail. I knew it used the Arduino IDE and that many of the Arduino libraries would work on it but I thought it was just a faster Arduino clone. What a mistake that was.</p>
<p>Turns out the Teensy is based on a Freescale ARM Cortex M4 processor which includes a wide range peripherals including two analogue to digital convertors, a 12bit digital to analogue convertor, 64K RAM and 256K Flash. It also supports a range of DSP instructions.</p>
<p>What made it even more interesting was the PJRC the developers of the Teensy had released an <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Audio.html">audio library</a> for the board making digital audio very straight forward.</p>
<p>As luck, would have it I happened to have a few <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy32.html">Teensy 3.2</a> boards on hand (impulse purchases from using <a href="http://oshpark.com/">OSH Park PCB services</a>). So, a few minutes later I had a development system configured and had run through a few of the Teensy audio examples. Within a couple of hours, I had my first working DSP filter &ndash; very cool!</p>
